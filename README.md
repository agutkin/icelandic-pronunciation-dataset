This is the [Icelandic Pronunciation dataset](http://malfong.is/?pg=framburdur) by Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson (released under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)) with some changes.

**Changes include:** Removal of regional variatiants, removal of homophones, fixes regarding [kʰ], [cʰ], [tʰ], and [dʰ] missing aspirations, several standardizations such as [œy] to [œi], [ɔu] to [ou].

**Known issues:** Several compound words that are supposed to include [kʰ], [cʰ], [tʰ], and [dʰ] in the middle are missing the aspirations – "barnakór" may for example be written as  [patnakouːr] and not [patnakʰouːr].
